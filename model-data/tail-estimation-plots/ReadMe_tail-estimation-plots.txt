These power law tail estimation plots were produced using the python script published with:

Voitalov, I., Van Der Hoorn, P., Van Der Hofstad, R., & Krioukov, D. (2019). Scale-free networks well done. Physical Review Research, 1(3). https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033034

The script and a description of its use is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ivanvoitalov/tail-estimation

Please refer to Voitalov et al. (2019) for more information on how these plots were generated and to better understand the information they present. 

The results from 11 simulations with the same parameters were combined to produce each of these plots. The file name describes the parameters used. For example, the file "0-5_m_500_sim_combined.pdf" indicates the growth rate exponent r=0.5, the simulation allowed mergers between depressions, and the starting number of depressions in the model space was 500. 

As described in the paper, we varied the following parameters:
	r = 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5
	Simulations with mergers (m) and no mergers (nm)
	n = 500, 750, 1000, 1250
